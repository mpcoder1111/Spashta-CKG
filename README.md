# Spashta-CKG: The Code Knowledge Graph for Agentic Coding

**Spashta** (Clear/Lucid) **CKG** is a lightweight, standardized architecture designed to give AI Coding Agents "Situational Awareness" of your codebase.

It solves the "Lost in the Woods" problem where AI agents hallucinate file paths, misunderstand architecture, or break existing logic because they lack a structured map of the project.

## 🚀 Why Spashta-CKG?

Most AI coding tools rely on RAG (Vector Search) or raw file reading, which is probabilistic and expensive. Spashta-CKG introduces a **Deterministic Architectural Memory**:

*   **Dual-Brain Architecture**:
    *   **Stage 1 (Body)**: 100% Accurate AST-based structure (generated by the tool).
    *   **Stage 2 (Mind)**: Semantic Understanding (enriched by the Agent).
*   **Hash-Based Updates**: Only re-analyze changed files.
*   **Hallucination Guardrails**: Agents query facts, they don't guess them.

## 📦 What's Included?

This repository contains the core specification and the reference implementation:

1.  **The Tool**: `build_kg_ast_based.py` - A zero-dependency Python script to generate the AST Knowledge Graph.
2.  **The Protocol**: `Code_Knowledge_Graph_Readme.md` - The schema and rules agents must follow.
3.  **The Proof**: `Case_Study_Agent_QnA.txt` - Real-world transcript of an Agent using CKG to analyze impact without reading code.

## 🛠️ Quick Start

1.  **Copy** the `Spashta-CKG` folder into your project root.
2.  **Run** the builder script:
    ```bash
    python Spashta-CKG/build_kg_ast_based.py
    ```
3.  **Result**: It generates `code_knowledge_graph_AST_based.json`.
4.  **Enrich**: Provide the [Sample Prompt](./Sample_Prompt_to_Agentic_IDE.txt) to your AI Agent (Cursor, Windsurf, etc.) to start using it.
