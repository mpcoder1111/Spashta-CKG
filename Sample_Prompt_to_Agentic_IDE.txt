Hello. This project follows a Code Knowledge Graph (CKG)–based architecture.

    1. First, read `Spashta-CKG/Code_Knowledge_Graph_Readme.md` to understand the architecture and rules.
    2. Check whether `Spashta-CKG/code_knowledge_graph_AST_based.json` exists.
       - If it does NOT exist, run: `python Spashta-CKG/build_kg_ast_based.py` to generate it.
    3. Check whether `Spashta-CKG/code_knowledge_graph_AST_Enriched_by_AI.json` exists.
       - If it exists, load it to understand the codebase.
       - If it does NOT exist, analyze the codebase as described in the README and create a new file named `code_knowledge_graph_AST_Enriched_by_AI.json` in the `Spashta-CKG/` folder with the required fields.

    After completing the above steps, explain the project architecture.  
    Acknowledge when you are ready; I will then provide the specific coding task.
